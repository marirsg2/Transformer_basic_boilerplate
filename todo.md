# Beyond basic models
If you're interested in more.
For the following, selecting a real-world or some enjoyable game-analogue setting
will help the concepts sink in.

## implement your own positional encodings
play with other types, or try torchtune ROPE
it helps to learn the details

## create your own synthetic dataset with a pattern than you want the xformer to learn
an interesting synthetic data gen project

## modify the expected behavior and try supervised fine-tuning and RLHF
modify the synthetic data gen to new nearby parameters, and see if the model finetunes well
